# OC240? parser

We have a legacy program that exchange bank transferts with a format used at
"Banque de France" (i think i read somewhere it's called OC240).

As we're working on SEPA currently, i found
[a file from the cocktail consortium](http://www.cocktail.org/gedfs/ged/courrier/commun/0407120933.0/Structure_fichier_240c.pdf?wgtg=_blank)
describing every field so i wrote a parser.

this is an experiment: i really would be sure to have the complete/right spec before publishing anything on CPAN.
